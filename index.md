## Space Bastards: An Overview of Men's Club Ultimate, Spring 2019

Frisbee has become a staple, if not a cliche, of the college experience.  For most, it’s just throwing a disc around on campus green spaces.  For others, it is a sport that hours of hardwork, dedication, sweat, and tears are poured into over four years, maybe even five.  Club Ultimate Frisbee takes the casual games and tossing that pop up sporadically to the next level.  Practicing up to eight hours a week, spending time outside of practice working out at the gym or getting in reps with a disc, traveling hundreds of miles away to compete against other schools all are essential parts of the club ultimate experience at the University of Maryland.  

The men's team at UMD is, for some unknown reason, named the Space Bastards.  To help them strategize and develop players, they made use of UltiAnalytics, a site that can track individual and team frisbee stats throughout the season.  They filmed all their games this semester, in order to rewatch them to either learn about opposing teams or collect their own stats and input them into the UltiAnalytics system.  Positive stats include assists, completions (throwing a disc to someone who catches it), catches, goals, and d's (causing the other team to turn possesion of the disc back to UMD).  Negative stats include throwawys (throwing a disc to someone who doesn't catch it), stalls (losing the disc because you held it for longer than 10 seconds), and drops.  All of these components come together to create a picture, through data, of the team's strengths and weaknesses.

This season in particular was strong for the Space Bastards.  With three players on the club team that also play for the professional DC team, the DC Breeze, UltiAnalytics helped the captains and coaching staff captialize on strong players, identify what skills specific players needed to work on, and build plays that would put the teams best foot forward.  In our data analysis, we have taken the data collected by the team and UltiAnalytics to determine how touches correlate to scoring efficiency.  Touches are any contact that a player has with the disc, whether they are picking it up off the ground to begin a possession or a completed catch.  In terms of scoring efficiency, we are looking to determine if the team's chances of scoring increase if they have a lot of people touch the disc.  Essentially, do they score more when they pass a lot, or when they make just a few moves?
